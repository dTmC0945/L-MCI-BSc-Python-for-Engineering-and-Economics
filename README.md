# A Gentle Introduction

Welcome to the lecture materials for use in **B.Sc - Python for
Engineering and Economics** where our focus will be on the topics of:

- Concept of Programming Language
- How to write programmes
- Working with Data
- Plotting Data
- Using Python as a Scientific Calculator
- Doing Economic Analysis

### Assignments

There will be two (**2**) assignments for this course.

The grade breakdown is as follows:

| DEFINITION              | GRADE (%) |
|-------------------------|-----------|
| Individual Assignment A | 40        |
| Individual Assignment B | 60        |
| Sum                     | 100       |

**Individual Assignment**

An individual assignment(s) will be given to you to work on. This
assignment will consist of questions pertaining to programming and will
require to write programmes to solve question or fix semi broken code.

The grade breakdown is as follows:

| DEFINITION | GRADE (%) |
|------------|-----------|
| Sum        | 100       |

**NOTE:** The assignment is individual and is not meant to be worked as
a group. Once the code and the work is submitted it will be vetted
against a software to determine if any collusion has occured.

## The Lecture Structure

As it currently is, the lecture covers topic from programming python to
methods in economic analysis. The structure of the lecture is shown

| 13 | Understanding Economic Growth | Using Python and Historical data to visualise GDP growth of countries | 8 |
| 15 | Life Cycles of Businesses | Empirical aspects of business cycles. | 9 |
| 16 | Introduction to Supply and Demand | Models of equilibrium prices and quantities, one of the core topics of elementary microeconomics. | 9 |
| 17 | Model Predictors | How to work through large data and general predictive models | 10 |
| 18 | Machine Learning & AI | Working with Neural Network and Building a small AI model | 11 |

## Code Supplement

The Code supplement is a Github webpage dedicated to hosting all the
relevant code used in the lecture as it is not feasible to fit all the
content of the code to the slides and it is easier to share this way.
